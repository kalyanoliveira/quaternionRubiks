Code for numerically representing a Rubik's Cube and the turning of its layers

This is just a simple repo containing some code for a paper I wrote during high school. It explored the quaternion number system, and I tried to create a model where you could numerically represent a Rubik's cube, including the turning of its layers.

If you want to understand it, I'd say just read the paper. The next goal here is to used OpenCV to create an actual visualization of the cube[quaternions and rubiks cube.pdf](https://github.com/kalyanoliveira/quaternionRubiks/files/9845835/quaternions.and.rubiks.cube.pdf)
